      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>If using jarred grape leaves as I am here, remove them from the jar and discard the brine. Rinse the grape
          leaves well and place them in a colander to drain. (Later in the process, you'll remove the stems before
          stuffing.) (See notes if using fresh grape leaves)</li>
        <li>Soak the rice in plenty of water for about 15 to 20 minutes or until you are able to break one grain of rice
          easily. Drain well.</li>
        <li>While the rice is soaking, cook the meat. Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet. Add
          onions and cook briefly, about 2 minutes or so, tossing until translucent. Add the meat and cook till fully
          browned, tossing occasionally. Drain any excess fat, then season the meat with kosher salt, pepper, and
          spices. Toss to combine. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the meat, drained rice, and fresh herbs. Season lightly with kosher salt. Add a
          generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and mix so that everything is well-incorporated.</li>
        <li>Prepare a heavy cooking pot and lightly brush the bottom with extra virgin olive oil. Arrange a few grape
          leaves in the bottom (I used the leaves that didn't look too great here and made three layers to protect the
          stuffed leaves from scorching later.) Top with sliced tomatoes.</li>
        <li>To stuff the grape leaves, you will work one leaf at a time. Place one grape leave on a cutting board the
          textured/rough side facing you. Take 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling and place in the center of the leave,
          then fold the sides over the filling and roll (think about this like rolling spring rolls or cigars.) Repeat
          with the remaining grape leaves or until you're out of stuffing.</li>
        <li>Neatly arrange the grape leaves in row, seam side down, in your prepared pot, covering the circumference of
          the pot. Then place a small plate inverted on top. Boil the broth or water and pour over the grape leaves,
          arriving at the top layer and somewhat covering (about 4 cups liquid, maybe a little more.)</li>
        <li>Now cover the pot with the lid and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes until the liquid has been absorbed.
          Uncover and remove the plate, then pour juice of 2 lemons. Cover again with the lid (no need for the plate at
          this point), cook on low heat for 30 to 45 more minutes or until fully cooked.</li>
      </ol>
